# Chicago Bikeability Map

An interactive cartogram visualizing bike traffic crashes and infrastructure across Chicago community areas.

This tool highlights crash counts, causes, and severity for each community area. It also scores biking infrastructure and network in each area and aggregates them into a custom Bikeability rank. Users can glean city-wide insights and help identify areas for improvement.
